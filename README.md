# EverydayScheduler
Everyday Schedule is a program that allows the user to keep track of what they are doing that day.
The data of what they are going to do is stored in local storage and rendered out onto the page on
either new save or on refresh.

For this webpage I experimented with jQuery. I still do not have a firm grasp on using it but it was
nice to get to work with it.
